<font face "Georgia"><i> "I had a marvelous time at Christie and Chris’s Cooking Cabin. I recieved a cooking class gift certificate for Christmas and could not wait to use it. The chef's who teach you are really kind and answered every question I had. I am going to bring my whole family with me next time! Don't think, book the classes!! Here are some great tips the chef told me to better prepare a rack of ribs:" </i></font>
<ol>
<i>
<li><font face "Georgia"> Use your favorite Dry Rub</font></li>
<li><font face "Georgia"> Cook the Ribs well enough so the meat falls right off the bone</font></li>
<li><font face "Georgia"> Use your favorite barbaque sauce, and lather it on</font></li>

Really a great place to go for date night, entertainment, or just learning how to cook delicious meals. Very nice staff and the chef's are great in explaining exactly what to do. Highly Recommend. Here are some of the things I bought at the class:" </i></font>
